<p>My name is Scott Chow, and I am going to show you how to start blogging. I have been building blogs and websites since 2002. In that time I have launched several of my own blogs, and helped hundreds of others do the same.</p>
<p>I know that starting a blog can seem overwhelming and intimidating. <strong>This free guide is all about blogging for beginners</strong>, and will teach you how to be a blogger with just the most basic computer skills. So whether you’re 8 or 88, you can create your own blog in less than 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I am not ashamed to admit that when I was first learning how to build a blog I made a ton of mistakes. You can benefit from more than a decade of my experience so that you don’t repeat these same mistakes when you make your own blog. I created this free guide so that anyone can learn how to blog quickly and easily. And if you get stuck at any point, please <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/contact-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">send me a message</a> and I will do my best to help you!<br />
<strong>Skip the rest of this introduction and <a href="#bloggingsteps">start building your blog!</a></strong></p>
<h3>What is a blog anyway?</h3>
<p>In short, <strong>a blog is a type of website that focuses mainly on written content</strong>, also known as blog posts. In popular culture we most often hear about news blogs or celebrity blog sites, but as you&#8217;ll see in this guide, you can start a successful blog on just about any topic imaginable.</p>
<p>Bloggers often write from a personal perspective that allows them to connect directly with their readers. In addition, most blogs also have a &#8220;comments&#8221; section where readers can correspond with the blogger. Interacting with your readers in the comments section helps to further the connection between the blogger and the reader.</p>
<p>This direct connection to the reader is one of the main benefits of starting a blog. This connection allows you to interact and share ideas with other like-minded people. It also allows you to build trust with your readers. Having the trust and loyalty of your readers also opens up the door to making money from your blog, which is something I discuss later in this guide.</p>
<h3>Should you start a blog?</h3>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1423" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/start-your-first-blog.png" alt="Simple steps to help you create a blog easily" width="289" height="256"><br />
One of the misconceptions about starting a blog is that you need to be a great writer to be successful. Nothing could be further from the truth. People read blog sites to get a personal perspective on things, so most bloggers write in a very informal and conversational style.</p>
<p>In addition, you don&#8217;t need to be an expert on your topic in order to have a successful blog. For example, readers of a cooking blog don&#8217;t want to read a textbook from a food scientist, they want to hear the experiences of someone who has actually cooked some real meals, mistakes and all.</p>
<p><strong>To be successful as a blogger there is really just one requirement: a passion for your topic.</strong></p>
<p>At its heart, blogging is about sharing your knowledge with the world. Choosing a topic that you are passionate about makes the process of starting a successful blog so much easier. Writing about more than one topic is totally fine too. As long as you are writing about things that you are genuinely interested in, your passion will shine through and keep your readers interested.</p>
<p>So why would you go to the trouble of blogging? There are a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make money from home.</strong> Blogging can be quite lucrative if done correctly. The top bloggers in the world obviously earn quite a bit, but even a part-time blogger can expect to make a nice profit if things are done correctly. The best part about it is that blogging is a form of passive income, since you can spend just a few hours a week writing a blog post and then continue to make money from it long after the blog post is written. I go into much more detail on how to blog for money later in this guide.</li>
<li><strong>Share your story.</strong> A blog allows you to have a voice and be heard. You can share your story with the entire world if you so choose. One of the most common ways blogs are used are as a diary where the blogger writes about their daily experiences so that friends, family, and others can all be a part of their lives.</li>
<li><strong>Recognition for yourself or your business.</strong> No, you probably won’t have paparazzi following you around because of your latest blog post. But a successful blog can gain you a ton of recognition in your respective field. Many bloggers are known as experts just because of their blogs, and some have even gotten book and movie deals based on their blogs.</li>
<li><strong>Find a community.</strong> Blogging at its heart is interactive. You write a blog post and people comment on it. This is a great way to connect with people who are interested in the same things as you are. Blogging allows you to teach these people based on your experience, and it gives you the opportunity to learn from your readers as well.<a name="bloggingsteps"></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The good news is that the internet is exploding with growth right now. More people than ever are online. This explosion in growth means more potential readers for your blog. In short, if you are thinking about starting a blog then there is no better time than right now.</p>
<p>So, just how do you start a blog?</p>
<h2>How to Start a Blog in 6 Steps</h2>
<p>Learn how to create a blog in about 20 minutes following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pick a blog name.</strong> Choose something descriptive.</li>
<li><strong>Get your blog online.</strong> Register your blog and get hosting.</li>
<li><strong>Customize your blog.</strong> Choose a free template and tweak it.</li>
<li><strong>Write &amp; publish your first post.</strong> The fun part!</li>
<li><strong>Promote your blog.</strong> Get more people to read your blog.</li>
<li><strong>Make money blogging.</strong> Choose from several options to monetize your blog.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s start your blog!</strong></p>
<h2>Step 1: Pick a blog name</h2>
<p>The first step to finding a good blog name is choosing your topic.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not sure what to blog about, there are <u>a few ways to find a good blog topic</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hobbies &amp; passions.</strong> Hobbies or other interests you are passionate about are a great place to start. Cooking, travel, fashion, sports, and cars are all classic examples. But even blogs about more obscure hobbies can be successful, since the your audience is literally anyone in the world with the internet.</li>
<li><strong>Life experiences.</strong> Everyone has lessons they have learned through life experience. Sharing this knowledge can be incredibly helpful to others in similar situations. For example, I recently helped a woman start her blog about being a fireman&#8217;s wife. She has a lot of experience and knowledge to share with others about this topic, and it has helped her connect with others in similar situations.Think about the things you have experienced in life. This could be related to your family (example: a blog about being a stay at home mom), work (a blog about experiences dealing with clients), or other life experiences (a blog about dealing with a troubling time such as a disease or divorce, or about a happy time such as preparing for a wedding or a birth of a child).</li>
<li><strong>A personal blog.</strong> A personal blog is a blog all about you. This will include a variety of topics, from things you do on a daily basis, to random thoughts and musings. This is a great way to share you thoughts with the world without having to stick to just one topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have a topic it&#8217;s time to choose your blog name.</p>
<p><strong>A good blog name should be descriptive</strong> so that potential readers can instantly tell what your blog is about just from the name.</p>
<p>If you are blogging about one specific topic then you will definitely want to include that in some way in your blog name. Try not to get hung-up on just one word though. For example, a cooking blog doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to have the word &#8220;cooking&#8221; in it. The words &#8220;food&#8221;, &#8220;recipes&#8221;, and &#8220;meals&#8221; would also let people know that your blog is about cooking.</p>
<p>If you are planning to create a personal blog where you discuss a variety of topics then I recommend using your name, or some variation of it, since your blog is all about you. For example, I own the blog scottchow.com. You can also add your middle name or middle initial if you find your name is already taken. Or you could use a variation like &#8220;Scott Chow Blog&#8221; or &#8220;Blogging with Scott&#8221;.</p>
<p>Once you have some blog name ideas you will need to <strong>choose a domain extension</strong>.<br />
A .com domain extension is the most preferred, but .net or .org work as well. It is also important to note that for the purposes of a blog domain you cannot have any spaces between words. So &#8220;Blogging with Scott&#8221; becomes bloggingwithscott.com</p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got your name and have picked an extension it&#8217;s time to make sure that no one else has already registered the same name:</p>
<h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See if your blog name is available</h3>
<div class="domain-check">
<form id="domain-check-form" method="post"><input id="input_domain_name" style="font-size: 13px;" name="input_domain_name" type="text" placeholder=" Enter blog name &amp; extension here..."><br />
<input id="input_domain_submit" name="input_domain_submit" type="submit" value="check availability"></form>
<div class="domain_check_result"></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Note: You cannot use any spaces or punctuation other than dashes in a domain name.</strong></p>
<p>If you find that the name you wanted is already taken there are a few things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Try a different domain extension.</strong> If the .com version is already registered you may still be able to get the .net or .org version of your blog name.</li>
<li><strong>Add small words.</strong> Words like &#8220;a&#8221;, &#8220;my&#8221;, or &#8220;the&#8221;. For example, this site is called TheBlogStarter.com instead of BlogStarter.com.</li>
<li><strong>Add dashes between words.</strong> For example, scott-chow.com</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2: Get your blog online</h2>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got a name picked out it&#8217;s time to get your blog online. This might sound hard or technical, but the steps below will walk you right through and <em>make the process easy</em>.</p>
<p>To get your blog up and running you need two things: blog hosting and blogging software. The good news is that these typically come packaged together.</p>
<p>A blog host is a company that stores all of the files for your blog and delivers them to the user when they type in your blog name. <strong>You must have a blog host in order to have a blog</strong>.</p>
<p>You also need to have the software to build your blog. In this guide I will be showing you how to build a blog using the WordPress blogging software, because it is the most popular, customizable, and easiest to use.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/bluesthost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1168" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/post-it1.gif" alt="post-it" width="250" height="200"></a>The blog host I recommend, and the one I show you how to use in this guide, is <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/bluesthost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueHost</a>. I personally use BlueHost and I recommend them for all new bloggers because:</p>

<li>They have helpful 24/7 customer service via phone or web chat.</li>
<li>They have a money-back guarantee if you are unsatisfied for any reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use any <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/bluesthost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueHost link</a> on this site to make sure you get the special discount price of $2.75 per month.</p>

<h3>3. Type in your domain name in the left box and then click “next” to start the registration process.</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you already own a domain name and want to use it for your blog, type your existing domain in the right box and then click &#8220;next&#8221;. Only use the right box if you have previously paid to register a domain!</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3607" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/choose-domain.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="376" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/choose-domain.jpg 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/choose-domain-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

</ul>

<h3>6. You will then need to create a password for your account.</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3602" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bluehost-password-2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="361" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bluehost-password-2.jpg 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bluehost-password-2-300x181.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Once you do that you can choose a basic design template for your blog (you can easily change this later, as you will see).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2486" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/choose-wordpress-theme.png" alt="" width="600" height="276" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/choose-wordpress-theme.png 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/choose-wordpress-theme-300x138.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>

<h2>Step 3: Customize your blog</h2>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3605" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bluehost-login.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="418" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bluehost-login.jpg 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bluehost-login-300x209.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Once you log-in you will be taken to your BlueHost Portal.&nbsp; From the portal you can click &#8220;Log in to WordPress&#8221; to be logged-in automatically to your blog.<br />
</span></p>
<h3>Changing your blog design</h3>
<p>Once you login you will be in the WordPress administrator area. This is where you can make any changes you want to your blog.</p>
<p>Everyone has a different idea of how they want their blog to look. One of the great things about a WordPress blog is that you can change your entire layout and design with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>In WordPress, blog layouts are known as “Themes”. What is a blog theme? Themes control the entire design of your blog. To change your theme you are going to click on the “Appearance” tab on the left menu.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2298" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-theme-install-1.png" alt="" width="600" height="281" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-theme-install-1.png 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-theme-install-1-300x141.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>You will see several themes are already installed on your blog: Twenty Seventeen, Twenty Sixteen, etc. These are well-designed, clean-looking themes that can work for just about any type of blog. In fact, many of the world&#8217;s top bloggers use one of these themes.</p>
<p>Unless you have a very specific design in mind for your blog, <strong>I suggest you use one of these themes to start with</strong>. For our example, let&#8217;s use the &#8220;Twenty Sixteen&#8221; theme. In order to activate the theme on your blog, hover over the theme and click the &#8220;Activate&#8221; button. That&#8217;s it! You have changed the entire design of your blog with just one click!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3613" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordpress-theme-activation.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="482" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordpress-theme-activation.jpg 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordpress-theme-activation-300x241.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like any of the themes that are already installed you can easily choose from thousands of other free themes. To install a new theme, click on the “Appearance” tab on the left menu and then click &#8220;Add New Theme&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3614" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordpress-theme-install.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="821" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordpress-theme-install.jpg 575w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordpress-theme-install-210x300.jpg 210w" sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /></p>
<p>This is the theme search screen.&nbsp; There are thousands of themes to choose from.&nbsp; You can change your entire design at anytime simply by activating a new theme.&nbsp; To find a theme you like, I suggest you click on the &#8220;Popular&#8221; tab and start browsing. When you find one that you like click the blue &#8220;Install&#8221; button.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2328" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wordpress-theme-install-5.png" alt="" width="600" height="369"></p>
<p>Once the theme is installed click &#8220;Activate&#8221; to activate the theme on your blog. To see your new theme in action, go to your blog and take a look!</p>
<p>Changing your theme is the simplest way to customize your blog, but there are lots of other customizations you can do. Check out my <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/step-4-configure-your-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full post on customizing your blog for an in-depth step-by-step guide</a>. You can also watch the video at the end of this guide to see me completely customize a blog from scratch.</p>
<h2>Step 4: How to write a blog post &amp; publish it</h2>
<p>Now that your blog is up and running it&#8217;s time to actually do some blogging!</p>
<p>Go to the left menu and click on “Posts”.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2292" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/write-blog-post-1.png" alt="" width="600" height="329" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/write-blog-post-1.png 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/write-blog-post-1-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>You will see there is already a post there. This is a default post on every new WordPress blog, and we don’t need it. To delete it click “Trash” just under the post.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2293" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/write-blog-post-2.png" alt="" width="600" height="258" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/write-blog-post-2.png 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/write-blog-post-2-300x129.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>To begin writing a new post, click the “Add New” link.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2294" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/write-blog-post-3.png" alt="" width="600" height="290" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/write-blog-post-3.png 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/write-blog-post-3-300x145.png 300w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/write-blog-post-3-580x280.png 580w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>You are now on the post editor screen. Enter the title of your post in the top box and then begin writing your post in the lower box.</p>
<p>If you would like to add a picture to your post, click on the &#8220;Add Image&#8221; icon and click &#8220;Upload&#8221; to upload a picture from your computer. You can make adjustments to the picture size on the next screen. When you are ready click &#8220;Insert into post&#8221; to add the picture.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3618" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/insert-image.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="323" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/insert-image.jpg 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/insert-image-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Once you have finished your post just click the “Publish” button on the top right side of the screen to publish it.</p>
<h3>Publishing Your Blog</h3>
<p>Even after you have written a post your blog may still be showing a &#8220;Coming Soon&#8221; page.</p>
<p>When you are ready to make your blog public just click the &#8220;BlueHost&#8221; menu at the top left of the menu in your administrator area then click the blue &#8220;Launch&#8221; button to remove the &#8220;Coming Soon&#8221; page.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3612" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordpress-coming-soon.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="216" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordpress-coming-soon.jpg 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordpress-coming-soon-300x108.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Congratulations! You now know how to start your own blog and publish content!</p>
<h2>Step 5: Promote your blog</h2>
<p>Creating a well-designed blog and writing great content is just the start. In order to get readers for your blog you will need spend some time promoting it, especially when you first start.</p>
<p>One of my favorite ways to get readers to my blog is to post links on my social media accounts like Facebook and Twitter. This is great, because not only do your friends see the link, but if your friends share the link with their friends it automatically multiplies your readers. If you have created high-quality content on your blog then social media is a great way for your blog to go viral.</p>
<p>In addition to getting new readers to your blog, you will also want to make sure your current readers are coming back. This is where email marketing plays a big role. By collecting the email addresses of your visitors (with their permission of course), you can then notify them when you post something new on your blog. This keeps people coming back to your blog, which not only gives you more readers over time, it also allows you to build a closer relationship with your readers.</p>
<p>Email marketing is too big a topic to cover well here, so I created a separate <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/why-all-bloggers-need-to-build-a-mailing-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide to email marketing</a> for those who are interested (hint: every blogger who wants more readers needs to read this guide).</p>

<h2>Step 6: Make money blogging</h2>
<p>Once you have put in the effort of creating great blog content and promoting your blog, making money from your blog is actually the easy part.</p>
<p>There are several ways you can make money blogging, from selling your own products or services, to getting paid to write reviews of products on your blog. But the easiest way to make money from your blog is to sell advertising space.</p>
<p>Once you have a popular blog, advertisers will be hounding you for the opportunity to advertise. The best way to take advantage of this situation is to use Google Adsense. They find the advertisers for you and all you have to do is place the Google Adsense code on your blog to start running ads. Google Adsense takes all of the hard work out of the process and just cuts you a check.</p>
<p>I go into the full details of <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/how-to-install-adsense-on-your-wordpress-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to set up Google Adsense for your blog here</a>. For more information see my <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/how-to-make-money-blogging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full guide to making money blogging here</a>.</p>
